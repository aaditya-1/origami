                    Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of
                    species to pass the
                    ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human
                    alphabet, differentiate
                    between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph. </li><br>
                <li>
                    Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such
                    as using the sun as
                    a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also
                    use landmarks as
                    signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.

                <li>
                    Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.

                    According to a study conducted by the University of Amsterdam, touching something comforting, even
                    if inanimate like a
                    teddy bear, can help those with low self-esteem with their existential/ life worries. People with
                    low self-esteem have
                    higher suicidal tendencies. When people tag their lives as meaningless, they struggle with their own
                    mortality and they
                    seem to question their own existence. In such cases, teddy bears may come in handy for people who
                    feel worthless. The
                    healing effect of a teddy bear helps individuals suffering from low esteem and gives their life a
                    meaning.

                    Working parents have no other choice, but to leave their kids either at home with the babysitter or
                    at day-care centres.
                    Sometimes being away from parents, especially the mother, leaves a negative effect on a child’s
                    mental well-being and
                    they become prone to depression, and anxiety. It also strains the relationship with parents. In a
                    situation like this, a
                    teddy bear can help soothe the kid’s pain and fear of separation from the parents as it becomes the
                    ‘transitional
                    object’, a comfort object which reminds the child of the mother. Dr Mundada explains, “The
                    transitional object may be
                    conceived of in three ways: as typifying a phase in a child’s development;

                    We can understand the struggle of sleeping with a partner who snores. But if you have nobody but a
                    teddy bear beside you
                    in bed, you are more likely to sleep like a baby. Not just this, people who have fears or who wake
                    up in the middle of
                    the night due to nightmares, can have better sleep with their teddy bear by their side. Your warm,
                    fuzzy friend won’t
                    disturb your night’s sleep. Go ahead and snooze off with your teddy bear if you are looking for a
                    partner who is silent,
                    warm and cosy!
